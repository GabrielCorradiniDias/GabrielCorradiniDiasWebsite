## About

Gabriel Corradini Lourenço Dias – Austin, TX.

Trained for nearly ten years in philosophy and religion (emphasis on metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of nature) before pivoting full-time into electrical engineering and plasma physics.

Current focus lies at the intersection of:
- Stochastic electrodynamics (SED) & quantum vacuum engineering  
- Direct energy conversion systems for aneutronic fusion  
- Propellantless propulsion concepts derived from polarizable vacuum models  

Since 2024 I work remotely with Douglas Miller at Zero Point Field Technologies LLC exploring practical implications of zero-point field fluctuations.

Everything published here is my own view, not affiliated with any institution.
