# Metaphysical Realism as Prerequisite for Vacuum Engineering

In Olavo de Carvalho's framework, recovering metaphysical realism isn't optional for physics—it's foundational. Quantum vacuum isn't "nothing"; it's a plenum of potentiality, echoing Aristotle's prime matter.

SED operationalizes this: ZPF as stochastic Lorentz forces, not probabilistic waves. Puthoff's polarizable vacuum? That's realism applied—dielectric response to fields, yielding propulsion without reaction mass.

Without realism, we get Copenhagen instrumentalism: math without ontology. With it? Engineering the ether.
